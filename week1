Reviews:
   This article is about Code Review(CR),and explains why, what and when to review.
   I think CR essential for improving legibility,maintainability and security and so on. Althought it cost too much time in the early, but can 
save a lot of time on code's maintenance.
   This article tell us steps to review in detail,which is helpful to review.
   In the end, it's my first try to comment using English.Consequently, it's slightly weird for you to read my comments.
   Good luck.
