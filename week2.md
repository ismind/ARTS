# R : 1, The first article is about 4 minutes to finish(link: https://blog.bitsrc.io/code-principles-every-programmer-should-follow-e01bfe976daf). 

1. Bit.dev is possibly helpful to frontend progrommer, howerver, I have more knowledge about backend.
2. The picture under the YAGNI title is interseting. I translate it into Chinese :
   1) 我们为app做了一个最快的引擎  2）那个鞍座是做什么用的？ 3）这就是那个app，我们花了不少预算在这个引擎上。
   （本来是要做app的，却专注于引擎上）
   The picture tell us it is not necessary to code for functionality that you may need in the future.
   Simply put — live in the present, not in the future.(简而言之，活在当下)
3，Clean code is better than clever code.(不要花里胡哨)Because you need to work with team not yourself, you should write understandable
code rather than a riddle for others. On other's standpoint, if they write a clever code rather clean code, how would you feel?
4, Finally, I repeat the famous words: "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."
